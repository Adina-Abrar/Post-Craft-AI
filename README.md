SocialAgent AI

Automated, Brand-Aware Social Media Content Creation for LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook

# SocialAgent AI

**Automated, Brand-Aware Social Media Content Creation for LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook**

---

## Project Overview

**SocialAgent AI** is an AI-powered assistant designed to automate the creation of realistic, human-like, and on-brand social media posts. It acts like a virtual junior social media manager and designer, helping marketing teams generate multiple post variations for campaigns, events, and announcements. The platform ensures brand consistency, optimizes posts for each platform, and allows iterative human-in-the-loop editing.  

This project is ideal for hackathons, startups, or small teams looking to save time while producing high-quality, visually appealing content across multiple social media platforms.

  - **Twitter/X:** Short, concise, impactful messages.  
  - **Facebook:** Engaging, community-oriented posts.

- **Agentic Self-Feedback Loop:**  
  AI reviews and improves posts internally before presenting them to users.
